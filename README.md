## About the codebase
The codebase contains a starter GitHub pages site inside the `docs/` directory, but you can use any content you'd like as long as the conditions specified in the [grading criteria](#grading-criteria) are met. 

A grading script and a setup utility exist inside of the `.github/` directory. You do not need to use these workflows for any purpose and altering their contents will affect the repository's ability to assess your lab and give feedback.

## Lab instructions

1. Create your own copy of this repository.
   - The easiest way to copy this repository is to click on **Use this template**. See *[Creating a repository from a template]* if you need assistance.
2. Complete the [grading criteria](#grading-criteria) in your newly created repository.
3. Your lab will be graded automatically when the grading criteria is met, this may take up to a minute.
   - To see the results of your lab, click on the **Actions** tab, select the **Grading workflow**, and select the most recent workflow run. See *[Viewing workflow run history]* if you need assistance. 
   - If your lab isn't graded, or you'd like to receive additional feedback from the workflow on your lab, click on the **Actions** tab, select the **Grading workflow**, click on **Run workflow**, select the appropriate branch (usually `main`), and click on the **Run workflow** button. See *[Running a workflow on GitHub]* if you need asssistance.

## Grading criteria

To successfully complete this lab, the following conditions must be met:
- GitHub Pages must be enabled
- The GitHub Pages site must use the `main` branch as the source
- The GitHub Pages site must use the `docs/` directory as the source
